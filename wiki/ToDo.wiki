#summary to-do list of items on the project

=== Josh's to-do list ===

Things that need to be dealt with:

  # should probably change all instances of $scene_name to $project_name; less confusing
  # need to figure out how $nameContext works and what exactly it does
  # add DAYSIM header file writing
  # add dialog that allows user to select layers for export?
  # add functionality to allow for the import of DAYSIM simulation results
  # add temporal map functionality?
  # improve the menus; add file chooser capability for paths, etc
  # some sort of materials functionality -- see DAYSIM tutorial (apparently there is a Sketchup materials file that can be downloaded; there is also some comment on the issue of material mismatches between the front and back sides of a face)
  # add something to preferences dialog to specify DAYSIM bin directory and material directory
