=== Josh's to-do list ===

Things that need to be dealt with:

  # Radiance dialogue: I'm pretty sure I won't need any of the Radiance rendering options in @radOpts; thus, if I can, I should try to rid the code of all references to @radOpts and the RadianceOptions dialogue entirely. This should probably wait until I have a better idea of how everything fits together.
  # Can I get rid of runPreview and related functionality? Probably
  # need to figure out how $nameContext works and what exactly it does
  # need to figure out parenttrans and $globalTrans
  # other things to potentially get rid of: copyReplFile, copyIESLuminaire (and other IES stuff)
