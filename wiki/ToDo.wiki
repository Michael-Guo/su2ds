#summary to-do list of items on the project

=== Josh's to-do list ===

Things that it would be nice change or add at some point:

  # add temporal map functionality?
  # improve the menus; add file chooser capability for paths, etc
  # figure out a way to export images with the results scale included in the image (right now screen captures are pretty much the only way to get this info out)
  # results palette: add option for displaying node values, improve rescaling speed, make box a little prettier (add some separators?)
