#summary to-do list of items on the project

=== Josh's to-do list ===

Things that need to be dealt with:

  # need to remove option mode dialogue from "export options," and make default mode "by layer"
  # Can I get rid of runPreview and related functionality? Probably
  # need to figure out how $nameContext works and what exactly it does
  # need to figure out parenttrans and $globalTrans
  # other things to potentially get rid of: copyReplFile, copyIESLuminaire (and other IES stuff)
  # add header file capability!
