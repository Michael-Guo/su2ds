su2ds allows users to create geometry in Sketchup, export it to [Daysim](http://www.daysim.com) for analysis, and import the results of this analysis back to Sketchup for display.

Installation files and a manual can be found on the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/su2ds/downloads/list) page.

su2ds was created by Josh Kjenner for [Manasc Isaac Architects](http://www.manascisaac.com), and is supported in part by the [National Research Council's IRAP](http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/ibp/irap.html). It is based on Thomas Bleicher's Radiance exporter plug-in for Sketchup, [su2rad](http://code.google.com/p/su2rad/).
